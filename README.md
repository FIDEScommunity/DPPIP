**Objectives** (still up for discussion)

Come up with a profile that can be used in a multi-credential and identifier type environment and can adapt to differences between the credential type available by the holder and the credential type requested by the verifier.

Harmonize international and European standards and frameworks on DPPs

Implement the profile in practical cases where real-life interoperability can be shown.

In the Trace4Eu meeting of october 4th 2024, it was decided that the UNTP protocol will be analyzed for relevance of acting as a base profile that can be extended.
